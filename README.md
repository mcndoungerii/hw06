# Clustering with Scikit-Learn Python

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates clustering techniques using Scikit-Learn in Python. It includes scripts and notebooks to perform clustering on datasets, visualize the results, and analyze the performance of different clustering algorithms. The main focus is on K-Means clustering, but the structure allows for easy addition of other clustering methods.

### Directory and File Description

- **data/**: Contains scripts to load and preprocess the input data.
  - `__init__.py`: Marks the directory as a Python package.
  - `input_data.py`: Script to load and preprocess input data for clustering.

- **main.py**: The main script to execute the clustering algorithms and visualize the results.

- **models/**: Directory intended to store trained clustering models. Currently empty, can be populated with serialized models.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and clustering.
  - `cluster_k_means.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating K-Means clustering.
  - `graph_for_input_data.ipynb`: Notebook for visualizing input data.

- **requirements.txt**: File listing the Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You'll also need `pip` to install the required libraries.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/mcndoungerii/hw06.git
   cd hw06
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Data Preparation**:
   Ensure your data is prepared and placed in the appropriate format expected by `input_data.py`.

2. **Using Jupyter Notebooks**:
   Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the provided notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open and run `notebooks/cluster_k_means.ipynb` for a demonstration of K-Means clustering or `notebooks/graph_for_input_data.ipynb` for data visualization.

## Project Details

### Clustering Algorithms

- **K-Means Clustering**: Implemented in the `notebooks/cluster_k_means.ipynb` notebook. This is a straightforward approach to partitioning data into k clusters.

### Data Visualization

Visualizations are crucial for understanding the clustering results. The `graph_for_input_data.ipynb` notebook provides methods to plot the data and visualize the clustering results.
